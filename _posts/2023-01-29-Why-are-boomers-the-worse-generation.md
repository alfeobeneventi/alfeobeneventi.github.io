title: Why is the boomer generation considered the worse in human history?
---


In this post I want to lay down the reasons why the boomer generation is considered the worse generation that has lived on this planet and why younger people have every right to hate boomer scum.

These guys had easy college access, tuition was like 10 bucks, houses were ungodly cheap, heck everything was cheap, marriage and kids were basically a given. I doubt they had to go through the stupidly long interview processes of today (probably just shake the hiring managers hand and get hired). And the stock market boomed like no other, and now it’s become a total rigged and manipulated meme for younger generation. They had everything laid out for them from previous generations then cut those same benefits that helped them and hiked up prices to become rich and screw over future generations. Terrible bunch of people they are.

Boomers inherited a country that was a manufacturing powerhouse. They had solid infrastructure and good affordable education. They outsourced to China, ignored the infrastructure (because lowering your tax bill by $10 a year was more important) and watered down and made education about profit. Now they hate China, refuse to acknowledge the failing infrastructure they neglected (and are leaving younger people with a huge bill) and complain how back in their day education was better. Yes, yes back in their day it probably was better and affordable thanks for fixing that for us!

Wars, reckless spending & use of debt, lack of savings all while demanding social security and healthcare that the economy they led simply cannot support. They've passed the buck to the next generation while calling them lazy and useless at every chance all while they had a huge amount of wealth and wasted it all, instead of investing it in the future. Now the younger generations will spend their lives cleaning up the mess of the baby boomers - pollution, financial crisis, wars, etc. and also have to support retired baby boomers who have no savings.

And there are so many of them, since they were born in a population boom. That gives them a big voting presence, so when they were young, they voted for a bunch of policies that benefited themselves by pushing the cost onto the future. Cheap education, easy finance, low property costs, lower taxes, technological development fueled by cheap energy, etc. They used those advantages to better themselves. Now that they're old they're voting to regress taxes, cut all the social services they benefited from, etc. So they got a bunch of benefits but aren't paying back what they took, and instead making the next generations pay for it. Except now they're living longer because of medical advances, so they are draining more social security than we accounted for. They've bought all the property so young people can't afford housing. They've ruined the environment with their overuse of cheap coal energy. Education costs have far, far outstripped inflation. They've allowed the wealth of the world to accumulate in their hands and created income disparity.

They rather let their kid commit suicide than actually lifting a finger to help, they take all the accomplishments The Greatest Generation achieved and call it their own. They brag how they know so much but they never taught their children or anybody younger than them. They refuse to acknowledge that they basically broke both the planet and the economy (twice), effectively leaving us with a pile of shit. The irony is that these scumbags actually think they’re the best.

Instead of holding the door open for those following behind them, they slammed it shut on their way through. They crossed the bridge that generations upon generations built, only to burn it as soon as they crossed it. Listening to boomers give life advices is like having a person with perfect eyes teaching "how to see" things to a blind since birth person: "It's easy! Just open your eyes! I can see up to 500m no problem! How do you fail to do that?!"

Thanks to boomers it feels like you need to work just to have the right to live. For many of us in our 20s or 30s a house is totally out of the question. I see many of my peers basically getting loans from their rich parents or inheriting houses from their parents and it makes me realize how the name of the game now is generational wealth.
