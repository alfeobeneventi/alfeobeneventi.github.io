title: 'Who Are the Germans/Nazis Who Sang Nazi Slogans At Sylt Island'
---
In this post I list all the buttfucks who participated at the infamous Nazi party in one of Sylt's exclusive Nazi clubs, [PONY Kampen](https://pony-kampen.de). They were stupid enough to capture the event on video and post it online.

This post is dedicated to doaxing the [German elite kids who sang Nazi paroles on Sylt island](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/24/outrage-at-footage-of-people-singing-nazi-slogan-at-party-on-german-island). The incident occurred at a party hosted by the notorious Nazi-affiliated club, [PONY Kampen](https://pony-kampen.de). The objective is to disseminate comprehensive information about these individuals to ensure that potential business partners, including companies and organizations, are fully informed about the nature and reputation of those they may engage with.

[Sylt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylt) is renowned as a popular vacation destination, frequented by affluent Nazi elites in Germany. For instance, in mid-April, Germany's former defense minister [Christine Lambrecht and her 21-year-old son Alexander Lambrecht took a private trip to the island of Sylt in Schleswig-Holstein, traveling in a military helicopter](https://deutschlandkurier.de/2022/05/familienurlaub-auf-sylt-lambrecht-nahm-sohn-im-regierungs-heli-mit/). The finance minister and chief of the pro-business Free Democratic party, Christian Lindner, married his partner there in July 2022.
The mayor of Sylt publicly opposed the [9€ Ticket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9-Euro-Ticket) during the height of the country's recent inflation, expressing concern that it would attract poor people and migrants to the island.

Here is the list of the individuals involved.

Elisa Maria Kowollik, who sings 'Foreigners out' in the video, is a student in Hamburg and worked for the influencer Milena Karl. After the video was published, she was immediately dismissed. The Hamburg University of Applied Sciences clearly distanced itself from her. Anyone with "von" in her or his name is nothing more than garbage to me. And garbage isn't worth anything.
