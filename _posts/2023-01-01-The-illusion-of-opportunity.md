title: The illusion of opportunity 
---


A lot of witless statements out there about blossoming lands of opportunity and equal economic mobility for every one. All horse rubbish. Especially for immigrants. This so called affirmations usually come from entitled boomers and privileged rich kids that have everything handed to them on a silver platter. Either because they so happen to be born at the right time or into the right caste. Yes, caste hierarchies do exist in western countries as well. In Germany, for example it is called nobility and people born into aristocracy are proud to carry the word _von_ as part of their name (e.g.: von Mutius) or by wearing a family ring. As if they are proud of their ancestors inhumane treatment of "peasants" that resulted in famine and widespread death by starvation and mistreatment. I guess they haven't overcome the fact that nobility was and is an archaic concept and not much different from autocratic and dictatorial constructs that we notice in other parts of the world where people not belonging in the right caste suffer until today. They still want to ram it down one's throat, because it arouses them. Some are even able to end up in politics, only due to lobbying with money they stole from people centuries ago or connections due to their wealth. I guess nothing has changed. Aristocrats are going to be aristocrats.
