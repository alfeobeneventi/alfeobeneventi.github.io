title: 'Don’t Be That Manager'
---

In this post, I delve into the characteristics of ineffective managers—often self-styled "leaders" who believe that merely adopting the title bestows upon them the qualities of true leadership.

For genuine insights on effective leadership, I recommend turning to reputable literature. However, I advise caution when considering the often superficial advice of popular figures like Simon Sinek. Despite his viral videos and widespread recognition, his guidance frequently lacks originality and depth. He epitomizes the "fake it till you make it" mentality, having no actual experience leading organizations or teams, yet somehow achieving a guru-like status as a leadership expert.

This post is a compilation of traits that define a bad boss, drawn from my personal experiences across various organizations. Let's begin.

### Weaklings Who Don't Walk The Talk
Managers who demand certain behaviors or standards but fail to lead by example, especially when those demands apply to themselves, undermine their credibility and effectiveness. Their frequent joking refrain, "Do as I say, not as I do," becomes a convenient excuse to avoid self-improvement. Wouldn't it be more effective to actually walk the talk?

### Setting Up Meetings That They Don’t Attent
My manager often schedules meetings—scrum, daily stand-ups, sync-ups, and the like—but skips them if it doesn't suit his schedule. For instance, if he needs to pick up his daughter from school, he simply skips the meeting. Yet, he insists that his direct reports attend these meetings regardless of their relevance or necessity. This behavior lowers morale and makes me question why I should put in any extra effort. It's not as if I enjoy these meetings in the first place. We all have places we'd rather be than the office. Home, for example.

### My Manager Calls In Sick Every Couple of Weeks
My manager frequently calls in sick, leaving his direct reports to pick up the slack. To address this, I've implemented my Pussy Manager Call-In-Sick Framework, or PuMaCS™. The concept is straightforward: every time my manager calls in sick, I follow suit the next day. By using this framework, I've managed to gain a few extra weeks of paid time off each year.

### Manager Is a Know-It-Alls
We all know them: people who think they know everything. This group seriously annoys me. It's amusing how some individuals constantly try to prove their intelligence or knowledge, even though they clearly lack both. They seize every opportunity to showcase their supposed expertise, but the truth is, they're often clueless.

The problem is simple: someone who believes they know everything won't invest time in expanding their knowledge. They won't read books, articles, or attend classes because, in their mind, they already know it all. Doing so would contradict their belief and seem like a waste of time. Why read about new, cutting-edge technology if you already have all the answers? This mindset ensures they remain ignorant.

Couple this with the Dunning–Kruger effect, where people with limited competence overestimate their abilities, and you've got the ultimate dumbass.

### Nepotism
My manager, who is married, often flirts and shows favoritism toward a younger female colleague, who is 30 years his junior and in a relationship. His behavior is frustrating, particularly because he seems oblivious to the inappropriateness and futility of his actions. This kind of conduct is not only unprofessional, given his marital status and the fact that he's targeting a subordinate, but also detrimental to the team's morale as it involves favoring less skilled individuals. To cope with this, it's best to minimize effort for the company and focus on personal side projects during work hours.


How do I deal with this? I simply avoid contradicting them, as it would be too energy-draining. Instead, I use my energy more productively. For example, I close my office door, put my feet up, and read books or work on personal side projects during work hours. This way, the company pays me while I get to focus on my personal interests and deliver nothing in return.
