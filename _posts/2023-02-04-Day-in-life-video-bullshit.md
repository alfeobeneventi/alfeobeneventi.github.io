title: Please stop making "day in the life" videos
---

We big tech employees enjoy a bunch of perks. I would like to continue receiving these perks as long as I can and am going to make an argument against making "day in the life" videos.

1. Attracts unwanted attention. This is attention from competitors, policy makers, decision makers at our companies etc. 
2. Poor reflection of our work and work ethic. A lot of us have worked incredibly hard to reach this stage in life and continue working hard everyday to maintain it. Our jobs don't revolve around the espresso machines, the snacks, the roof top, but these are nice to have and do make us more productive. These videos make people believe that all tech workers do is eat and chill at work. 
3. Respect for those in more unfortunate circumstances. Billions of people work incredibly hard, just to scrape two meals a day. Don't add insult to injury by showcasing to the world how "awesome" we are. 
4. Workplace policy violations. Most of these clout hungry posters are in violation of policies at work. Do you want to give management a reason to let you go?
4. Karma. Look at what's happened to a lot of these people. So many were let go and no one feels bad for them.

Please, stop.
