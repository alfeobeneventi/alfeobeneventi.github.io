title: Let us talk about tech layoffs
---

Companies hate saying the word layoff because they don't have the balls to tell things how they are. But at the end of the day all, and I mean all companies, treat employees like a fucking condom. They don't give a shit about them. 

They use them and when their done with them or want to focus on other ventures they will not hesitate to throw them away to cut costs or hire new talent instead of retraining existing ones. 

Take Workday for example. Most of their engineers are using their proprietary piece of shit garbage programming language XpressO that Workday introduced back in 2005 in the hopes to lock in talent. Years of outcry by engineers that this technology is horse rubbish and not sustainable in todays environment was ignored by management. Until Workday's Aneel Bhusri finally realized that if they want to continue to do business in the future so that he can by his daughter a new yacht, he has to focus on new technology. That's why he stated that Workday needs to hire more ML engineers and fire existing loyal employees. Sure if Google and co are shedding talent, it might be a good opportunity to replace existing engineers with freshly layed off Google engineers who might be willing to even take a pay cut. Awesome leadership there buddy. Great job Mr. Anal Bushri.

Workday calls the firing of 500 employees in a January 31, 2023 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission "a realignment of resources". At the same time they [announce](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/01/17/workday-co-ceo-were-going-to-add-several-thousand-new-heads-this-year.html?es_id=9e923ba402) that they want to hire thousand new people in 2023. A company that refers to human beings as "resources" is a big red flag for me. What is this? The 17th century?

"A step in a broader set of proactive organizational and strategic changes" is what Splunk CEO Gary Steele refers to the firing of 4% of their staff. The only persons that should be canned are the CEO and the people that come up with this bullshit.

Then you have your activist investors. Activists "fighting" for shareholders. These are usually hedge funds like the unknown TCI Fund Management group whose so called expert stock pickers are not able to beat the indices and resort to other means like buying a significant minority stake in a publicly traded company in order to change how it is run. They then use their equity stake in a corporation to put pressure on its management to fire people and cut costs, regardless of whether this is healthy for the company in the long run. That way they usually manage to get a few basis points return for their clients for the next quarter and justify their obscene fees. Management usually succumbs to this pressure being the little Walls Street whores that they are. They like taking it up their arse. Google eliminates 12000 jobs, or roughly 6% of the full-time workforce and then goes and announces stock buybacks.

My advice for young people working at these companies. 

1. Try to get a remote position and work for many companies at the same time, so if you get laid of at one position, you still have a backup.
2. Do as little work as possible and if you find a new better job don't give notice to your other company. Just walk away if tip 1 does not apply.
3. Company loyalty is naive. You are not an idiot now are you? 

You are just a number to these corporations. At Workday people get a made-in-China mug when joining that literally has their employee number printed on it.
