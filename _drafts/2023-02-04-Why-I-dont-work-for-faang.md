title: Why I don't work for FAANG
---

When I was a student some years back, I used to think it must be so good to work in Google and how it's the best company and dream job.

Some years being actually in the industry and I laugh at myself when I think about those past times. Almost all of FAANG is shit and let me tell you why, they have become too big and lost the charm which made them the best. It's a problem with every company out there. Easy to maintain culture when you're small. You grow and try to become the most valuable company in the world and all you are left with is bunch of crony capitalists who have no passion towards tech. I am seeing this at a very small scale with lots of startups which get acquired. Their culture and product is destroyed because the bigger company just can't handle their way of functioning and employees leave no matter how hard they try to retain them.

Pichai is a typical South Indian with a boomer personality. And it's fine, he cannot change it as he grew up in that environment. And don't call me racist, I myself come from similar background so I can relate. He did everything his parents asked from him, so that he can be their golden egg and solve their problems. Did IIT, travelled to USA, did his Master's, married and had children, became a CEO by climbing the corporate ladder. Did everything almost no questions asked. He's a follower, not a thinker. Never bothered to revolutionize nor believed in questioning the set way of doing things. Now what else can you expect from him, he is just a puppet installed by Board or Investors. Google is not the place for innovators or leaders today, it is a place to get a job and obey the ones at the top!
